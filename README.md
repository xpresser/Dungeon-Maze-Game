# Dungeon-Maze-Game
This is a 2D Maze console-based game concept wich is working, despite not having any visual effects.
The game starts with a player, in a room of the dungeon, whose goal is to find the room with the exit.
Some rooms have open doors, some do not. You can find an item or a monster, so be careful.
